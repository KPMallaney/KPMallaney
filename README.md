If you'd like to see some examples of the interesting custom SQL I have written to get my data formatted properly in Tableau, you can do that [here](https://github.com/AnniesAnalytics/Nested-Sets-SQL-to-Tableau-Project). If you're more interested in the Python scripts that I have written to clean, generate, and document data at my job, you can find that [here](https://github.com/AnniesAnalytics/Python-codes).
